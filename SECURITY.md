## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create a Public Issue

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This could put users at risk.

### 2. Report Privately

Send an email to: **security@yourcompany.com** (replace with actual email)

Include the following information:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (if you have them)

### 3. Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity, typically within 30 days

### 4. Disclosure Process

1. We will acknowledge receipt of your report
2. We will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. We will develop and test a fix
4. We will release a security update
5. We will publicly disclose the vulnerability (with credit to you, if desired)

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

1. **Keep Updated**: Always use the latest version
2. **Secure Configuration**: 
   - Use strong API keys
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Use HTTPS in production
   - Regularly rotate credentials

3. **Environment Variables**: Never commit sensitive data to version control

4. **Network Security**: 
   - Use firewalls to restrict access
   - Monitor network traffic
   - Use VPNs for remote access

### For Developers

1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize inputs
2. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
3. **Authorization**: Follow principle of least privilege
4. **Logging**: Log security events but avoid logging sensitive data
5. **Dependencies**: Regularly update dependencies and scan for vulnerabilities

## Security Features

### Built-in Security

- **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
- **Input Validation**: All inputs are validated using Zod schemas
- **Error Handling**: Errors don't expose sensitive information
- **Logging**: Security events are logged for monitoring

### Configuration Security

```yaml
# Example secure configuration
security:
  rateLimit:
    windowMs: 900000  # 15 minutes
    max: 100         # limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  
  cors:
    origin: ["https://yourdomain.com"]
    credentials: true
  
  headers:
    contentSecurityPolicy: true
    hsts: true
```

## Vulnerability Scanning

We use automated tools to scan for vulnerabilities:

- **Dependabot**: Monitors dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **CodeQL**: Static analysis for code vulnerabilities
- **Trivy**: Container image scanning
- **SonarCloud**: Code quality and security analysis

## Security Updates

Security updates are released as patch versions and are clearly marked in:
- Release notes
- GitHub Security Advisories
- Email notifications (if subscribed)

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices including:
- OWASP Top 10 guidelines
- Node.js security best practices
- Docker security guidelines
- API security standards
